# Traffic Light Optimization Using Reinforcement Learning (DQN) in SUMO

This project focuses on optimizing traffic light control at a real-world intersection in **WrocÅ‚aw, Poland**, using reinforcement learning techniques. The simulation is powered by **SUMO**, while the training process is based on a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent. An interactive GUI is provided via **Tkinter**.

---

## ðŸš¦ Real Data Integration

- **Real Intersection**: The simulated intersection replicates an actual junction in WrocÅ‚aw.
- **Traffic Data**: Hourly traffic volumes were collected using the **TomTom API** and loaded into SUMO.
- **Traffic Light Timing**: Baseline phase durations were **measured manually** on-site for each signal.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- DQN agent for adaptive signal phase control.
- SUMO-based simulation of real traffic conditions.
- Adjustable neural network parameters via the GUI.
- Visual or hidden simulation modes.
- Result logging, comparison, and plotting of wait time improvements.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure (Modules Overview)

| Module         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`main.py`**        | Launches the Tkinter GUI. Allows configuration of simulation parameters, training settings, and visual result management. |
| **`Uczenie.py`**     | Contains the **DQN agent**, training loop (`DNQTrainer`), and logic for optimizing phase durations using Q-learning. |
| **`Konwerter.py`**   | Acts as the main bridge between SUMO and the DQN agent. Applies learned signal timings and evaluates performance. |
| **`config.py`**      | Centralized configuration file with all simulation and learning parameters (e.g. gamma, epsilon, traffic scale, file paths). |
| **`Raportowanie.py`** | Generates **comparative plots** and metrics showing baseline vs optimized wait times per lane using `matplotlib`. |
